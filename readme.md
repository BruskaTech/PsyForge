# UnityEPL Overview
UnityEPL (Unity Experiment Programming Library) can help researchers and scientists easily collect data from their Unity3D projects.  To use UnityEPL, all you need to do is download the asset from the asset store, import it, and add components to objects in your Unity3D scene.

There are two types of components: reporters and handlers.  Reporters allow you to choose what data you care about in your Unity3D project.  Handlers let you decide what to do with the data.

To add either type of component, select a game object in the object heierarchy (the left panel in the default Unity3D layout).  Then, select "Add Component" in the inspector (the right panel in the default Unity3D layout.)

In the "Add Component" dropdown, select "UnityEPL," then "Handler" or "Reporter."  You will then be able to configure the component.
