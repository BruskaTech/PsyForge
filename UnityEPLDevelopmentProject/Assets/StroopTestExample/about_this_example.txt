In this example experiment, participants are presented with a series of color/word stimuli reminiscent of the classic Stroop test.

The StroopExperiment class demonstrates how to use UnityEPL.AddParticipant(), UnityEPL.SetExperimentName(), TextDisplayer, and, most importantly, ScriptedEventReporter.

Please refer to the documentations for the above listed classes and functions for more information.  Documentation is available here: https://github.com/pennmem/UnityEPL
